There is no "right" answer to these questions, use this paper as an opportunity to better present yourself, your interests, and your skills. Since this paper can very well represent your unique situation, please try to avoid vague or canned responses, and show your true value outside of your CV.

- Be honest and specific in your answers.
- Highlight your unique experiences and skills.
- Show your enthusiasm for research and learning.
- Proofread your application before submitting.

What Happens Next?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will try to get back to you as soon as possible (you know how academics sometimes are rather busy), whether you are a match or not with our lab, and provide feedback that could be useful for your future applications. If a match appears to be present, we will contact you to schedule an interview and discuss further steps.
