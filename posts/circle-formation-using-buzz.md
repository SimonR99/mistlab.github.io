When we designed our language [Buzz](http://the.swarming.buzz), we wanted to create something that could be ported to any robot.
We have made an initial port of Buzz for a popular robotic platform, the [Khepera IV](http://www.k-team.com/mobile-robotics-products/khepera-iv).
The result of this port is a "glue" library that provides a set of functions for controlling the robot to the Buzz interpreter. As usual,
we have released the (still unfinished!) code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MISTLab/BuzzKH4). The total integration work was only a couple of days'
work, a testament to the portability of Buzz.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

So we can now proudly show an example of Buzz at work: we programmed the Kheperas with a simple algorithm that, without computation,
leads to circle formation. The algorithm itself will be the subject of a future publication. What the video shows is that the robots
can be successfully controlled and their sensors used to perform swarming tasks:
